About.helptext=<html><p>This small application simulates Connway's Game Of Live. \
</p><p>\
Black areas are living cells, white areas dead ones. You \
can switch them by clicking. You can hold the mouse button \
and move accross the screen to switch many cells at once. \
</p><p>\
You can step forward to the next generation using the menu \
or using the key strokes using a single generation step or \
letting the application do the steps regularly. \
</p><p>The cells \
live or die according to the following two rules: \
<ul>\
<li> Dead cells only become alive if they have exactly three \
living neighbours.</li>\
<li> Living cells only stay alive if they have three or four \
living neighbours.</li>\
</ul>\
'Neighbour' means one of the eight cells around a cell. \
