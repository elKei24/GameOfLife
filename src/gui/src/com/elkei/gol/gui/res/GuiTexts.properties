About.helptext=<html><p>This small application simulates Connway's Game of Live. \
</p><p>\
Black areas are living cells, white areas dead ones. You \
can switch them by clicking. You can hold the mouse button \
and move accross the screen to switch many cells at once. \
</p><p>\
You can step forward to the next generation using the menu \
or using the key strokes using a single generation step or \
letting the application do the steps regularly. There is a \
counter at the bottom of the window that shows in which \
generation since the last manual change of the board you \
are.\
</p><p>The cells \
live or die according to the following two rules: \
<ul>\
<li> Dead cells only become alive if they have exactly three \
living neighbours.</li>\
<li> Living cells only stay alive if they have two or three \
living neighbours.</li>\
</ul>\
'Neighbour' means one of the eight cells around a cell. \
</p>\
<p>If you want to save the current board permanently, you \
can do that in the "File" menu. There you also find the \
"Open" action to load the stored board later on. \
Furthermore, you can also find the actions to resize the \
board or to create a new, empty one. \
